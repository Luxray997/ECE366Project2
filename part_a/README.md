Group Contribution for Part 1a
For Part 1a, all members contributed equally (33%) to the project, ensuring a balanced distribution of work in coding, debugging, and project management.

Akbar Aman (aaman7@uic.edu) was responsible for developing the core assembly (MIPS) code and writing structured pseudocode in Python to guide the implementation.

Luke Abraham (lukeca3@uic.edu) also contributed heavily to the MIPS coding and created the GitHub repository, ensuring proper version control and collaboration.

Ugo Alozie (ualoz2@uic.edu) assisted in ASM coding and focused on debugging to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the implementation.

Together, the team worked collaboratively to complete Part 1a successfully.
