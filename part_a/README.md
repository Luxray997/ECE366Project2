How to Run the MIPS Program
Open MARS Simulator – Ensure you have MARS MIPS simulator installed.

Load the .asm file – Open the provided Fibonacci.asm file in MARS.

Assemble the Code – Click on "Assemble" to compile the assembly program.

Run the Program – Click "Run", and when prompted, enter an integer n.

View Output – The program will compute and display the nth Fibonacci number.

This project implements the Fibonacci sequence in MIPS assembly, allowing a user to input a value n and receive Fibonacci(n) as output. The computation follows an iterative approach for efficiency, and the implementation correctly handles any base case the user prompts.
